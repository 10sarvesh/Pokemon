My project is based on TV cartoon series Pokemon. Pokemon is a fictional animal or bird based creature. 
In this project, I have developed a Naive Bayes Classifier model in R studio to predict the "type" of pokemon based on certain characteristic variables and also to predict whether it is "legendary or not".
In this repository I have uploaded the csv dataset, R script file and the pdf containing code and its corresponding output.
Classification report along with confusion matrix are highlighted in the report.
